# EM5820 Thermal Printer USB Driver

Header-only driver to provide USB communication support between linux devices and an EM5820 thermal printer. Quick example of usage is contained in `main.cpp`.

> [!CAUTION]
> This small driver was created by reverse engineering the printer library code in `PrinterLib.dll` and it is not guaranteed to be accurate (I do not, in fact, speak chineese).
